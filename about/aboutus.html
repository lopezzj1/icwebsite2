				<h3>What is the Instructional Center?</h3>
				<p>The Committee on Learning Skills Centers says that "it is a special place where students come for special instruction not usually included in 'regular' classrooms." This means that the Instructional Center (IC) is a place where students can take their time to learn and where students are not afraid to ask questions. It is a place where students study together and develop support groups and lasting friendships. The IC is truly a special place at the University of Washington.</p>

				<p>Studies show that students who attend learning centers achieve better grades and are more successful during their college careers. The Instructional Center provides academic support for OMAD students.  By using the Instructional Center regularly you will:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Reduce study time by learning to study more effectively</li>
					<li>Become better prepared for exams by learning concepts and mastering course material</li>
					<li>Develop a more personalized approach to learning</li>
					<li>Develop confidence in your academic abilities</li>
					<li>Have the opportunity to study cooperatively in small groups</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are instructors and tutors available for almost every academic discipline or major with an emphasis in Math, Science, Engineering and Technology. In addition to extra instruction for your courses, the IC also offers:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A complete computer lab with up-to-date hardware and software, as well as access to the Internet</li>
					<li>Preparation Workshops for the DAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, OAT and PCAT</li>
					<li>Study Skills Sessions and Assessments</li>
					<li>Courses in Critical Reading for Speed and Comprehension</li>
